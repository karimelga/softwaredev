The document above may be revised... any substantive changes will be announced in class.

The location in Gradescope to submit the homework will be published next week. Note the deadline is 5 PM on 1/23. No late work is accepted.

In IntelliJ, create a new project named Homework 1 to house this work. The program should start by running a class called Main. Your project should have a folder for src, a folder for docs, and a folder for tests.

You may have other questions... bring them to class next Tuesday.




Given the sonnet below, the program writes out the sonnet and stops at a random word, printing a series of underscores instead, and not printing the rest of the sonnet. The program prompts the user for the next word. Once the user responds, the program indicates correct or error, and restart the sonnet, stopping at a different word. Program continues until the user gets three correct or three words incorrect.

Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their death bury their parents’ strife.
The fearful passage of their death-mark’d love,
And the continuance of their parents’ rage,
Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,
Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;
The which if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
